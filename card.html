        <p>The notrthern lights also known as aurora borealis are found in high altitude regions around the arctic. They display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky. </p>
        <p>The lights we see in the night sky are in actual fact caused by activity on the surface of the Sun. Solar storms on our star's surface give out huge clouds of electrically charged particles which can travel millions of miles</p>
        <p>Particles from the sun collide with atoms in the atmosphere and heat them up. The aurora's characteristic wavy patterns and 'curtains' of light are caused by the lines of force in the Earthâ€™s magnetic field.</p>
